# Bread Hub

Welcome to Bread Hub! This is where I showcase everything I do. It's also a ~~cool~~ silly page where you can mess around and do stuff. 

Here, youâ€™ll find all my projects that Iâ€™ve worked on. From video editing to music composing, 3D art, game development, and even sound design, Iâ€™m into a lot of things, and this site is the place to keep track of it all.

You can also find some stuff about me on the page, some of the stuff there is just for fun and this acts as my main page, it doesn'yt lean much into project displaying or silly stuff, it's somewhere in the middle.

This page is in the works, so that means it's not finished yet, I will work on this a lot so stay tuned for updates. As I am writing this I haven't done anything yet, so scroll down a bit to find a list of features I will implement, thank you for reading these paragraphs! Byeee <3
